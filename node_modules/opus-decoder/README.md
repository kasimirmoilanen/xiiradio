# `opus-decoder`

`opus-decoder` is a Web Assembly Opus audio decoder.
  * 87.2 KiB minified bundle size
  * Browser and NodeJS support
  * Built in Web Worker support
  * Based on [`libopus`](https://github.com/xiph/opus)

See the [homepage](https://github.com/eshaz/wasm-audio-decoders) of this repository for more Web Assembly audio decoders like this one.

### [Checkout the demo here](https://eshaz.github.io/wasm-audio-decoders/)

## Installing
* Install from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/opus-decoder).

  Run `npm i opus-decoder`

  ```javascript
  import { OpusDecoder } from 'opus-decoder';

  const decoder = new OpusDecoder();
  ```
 
* Or download the [build](https://github.com/eshaz/wasm-audio-decoders/tree/master/src/opus-decoder/dist) and include it as a script.
  ```html
  <script src="opus-decoder.min.js"></script>
  <script>
    const decoder = new window["opus-decoder"].OpusDecoder();
  </script>
  ```

## Usage

1. Create a new instance and wait for the WASM to finish compiling. Decoding can be done on the main thread synchronously, or in a webworker asynchronously.

   **Main thread synchronous decoding**
   ```javascript
   import { OpusDecoder } from 'opus-decoder';

   const decoder = new OpusDecoder();

   // wait for the WASM to be compiled
   await decoder.ready;
   ```

   **Web Worker asynchronous decoding**
   ```javascript
   import { OpusDecoderWebWorker } from 'opus-decoder';

   const decoder = new OpusDecoderWebWorker();

   // wait for the WASM to be compiled
   await decoder.ready;
   ```

1. Begin decoding Opus frames.

   ```javascript  
   // Decode an individual Opus frame
   const {channelData, samplesDecoded, sampleRate} = decoder.decodeFrame(opusFrame);
   
   // Decode an array of individual Opus frames
   const {channelData, samplesDecoded, sampleRate} = decoder.decodeFrames(opusFrameArray);
   ```

1. When done decoding, reset the decoder to decode a new stream, or free up the memory being used by the WASM module if you have no more audio to decode. 

   ```javascript
   // `reset()` clears the decoder state and allows you do decode a new stream of Opus frames.
   decoder.reset();

   // `free()` de-allocates the memory used by the decoder. You will need to create a new instance after calling `free()` to start decoding again.
   decoder.free();
   ```

## API

Decoded audio is always returned in the below structure.

```javascript
{
    channelData: [
      leftAudio, // Float32Array of PCM samples for the left channel
      rightAudio // Float32Array of PCM samples for the right channel
    ],
    samplesDecoded: 1234, // number of PCM samples that were decoded
    sampleRate: 48000 // sample rate of the decoded PCM
}
```

Each Float32Array within `channelData` can be used directly in the WebAudio API for playback.

## `OpusDecoder`

Class that decodes Opus frames synchronously on the main thread.

### Getters
* `decoder.ready` *async*
  * Returns a promise that is resolved when the WASM is compiled and ready to use.

### Methods

* `decoder.decodeFrame(opusFrame)`
  * `opusFrame` Uint8Array containing a single Opus frame.
  * Returns decoded audio.
* `decoder.decodeFrames(opusFrames)`
  * `opusFrames` Array of Uint8Arrays containing Opus frames.
  * Returns decoded audio.
* `decoder.reset()` *async*
  * Resets the decoder so that a new stream of Opus frames can be decoded.
* `decoder.free()`
  * De-allocates the memory used by the decoder.
  * After calling `free()`, the current instance is made unusable, and a new instance will need to be created to decode additional Opus frames.

## `OpusDecoderWebWorker`

Class that decodes Opus frames asynchronously within a web worker. Decoding is performed in a separate, non-blocking thread. Each new instance spawns a new worker allowing you to run multiple workers for concurrent decoding of multiple streams.

### Getters
* `decoder.ready` *async*
  * Returns a promise that is resolved when the WASM is compiled and ready to use.

### Methods

* `decoder.decodeFrame(opusFrame)` *async*
  * `opusFrame` Uint8Array containing a single Opus frame.
  * Returns a promise that resolves with the decoded audio.
* `decoder.decodeFrames(opusFrames)` *async*
  * `opusFrames` Array of Uint8Arrays containing Opus frames.
  * Returns a promise that resolves with the decoded audio.
* `decoder.reset()` *async*
  * Resets the decoder so that a new stream of Opus frames can be decoded.
* `decoder.free()` *async*
  * De-allocates the memory used by the decoder and terminates the web worker.
  * After calling `free()`, the current instance is made unusable, and a new instance will need to be created to decode additional Opus frames.

### Properly using the Web Worker interface

`OpusDecoderWebWorker` uses async functions to send operations to the web worker without blocking the main thread. To fully take advantage of the concurrency provided by web workers, your code should avoid using `await` on decode operations where it will block the main thread.

Each method call on a `OpusDecoderWebWorker` instance will queue up an operation to the web worker. Operations will complete within the web worker thread one at a time and in the same order in which the methods were called.

  * **Good** Main thread is not blocked during each decode operation. The example `playAudio` function is called when each decode operation completes. Also, the next decode operation can begin while `playAudio` is doing work on the main thread.
    ```javascript
    const playAudio = ({ channelData, samplesDecoded, sampleRate }) => {
      // does something to play the audio data.
    }

    decoder.decodeFrame(frameData1).then(playAudio);
    decoder.decodeFrame(frameData2).then(playAudio);
    decoder.decodeFrame(frameData3).then(playAudio);

    // do some other operations while the audio is decoded
    ```

  * **Bad** Main thread is being blocked by `await` during each decode operation. Synchronous code is halted while decoding completes, negating the benefits of using a webworker.
    ```javascript
    const decoded1 = await decoder.decodeFrame(frameData1); // blocks the main thread
    playAudio(decoded1);

    const decoded2 = await decoder.decodeFrame(frameData2); // blocks the main thread
    playAudio(decoded2);

    const decoded3 = await decoder.decodeFrame(frameData3); // blocks the main thread
    playAudio(decoded3);
    ```
